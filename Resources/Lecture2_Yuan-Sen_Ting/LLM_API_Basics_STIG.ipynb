    "\n",
    "You might reasonably ask: \"If LLMs can write code for me through ChatGPT, why do I need to learn \n",
    "to code with them?\" It's a fair question that deserves a thoughtful answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Web Interface is Training Wheels**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using ChatGPT or Claude through a browser is like using a calculator—it's great for one-off questions, \n",
    "but imagine if you needed to do the same calculation 1,000 times. You wouldn't manually type each one. \n",
    "Similarly, when you need to:\n",
    "- Analyze abstracts from 500 papers\n",
    "- Generate consistent summaries of observation logs\n",
    "- Create custom research tools that combine AI with your data\n",
    "\n",
    "...you need programmatic access.\n",

    "- Extracting key findings from every paper on exoplanet atmospheres published this year\n",
    "- Generating natural language summaries of your spectroscopic observations\n",
    "- Building a custom chatbot that answers questions about your telescope's documentation\n",
    "- Creating an AI assistant that can both query astronomical databases AND reason about the results\n",

    "## Understanding APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's demystify this term that gets thrown around constantly in programming. API stands for Application Programming Interface, but that definition helps nobody. Here's a better way to think about it: an API is a structured way for programs to talk to each other. When your Python code needs to communicate with an LLM running on a server somewhere, the API defines exactly how that conversation happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like ordering at a restaurant. You (your Python code) don't walk into the kitchen and start cooking. Instead, you look at a menu (the API documentation), place an order with specific requirements (the API request), and receive your meal (the API response). The waiter (the API) handles all the communication between you and the kitchen (the LLM). You don't need to know how the kitchen works, what equipment they use, or who's cooking—you just need to know how to order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In concrete terms, when you want an LLM to analyze text, you send a specially formatted message over the internet to the LLM's servers. The message contains your prompt, along with parameters like which model to use and how long the response should be. The server processes your request and sends back a response containing the LLM's output. All of this happens in seconds, and it's all just Python dictionaries and strings—data structures you already understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of APIs is standardization. Whether you're using OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini, the basic pattern remains the same: format your request, send it to the server, receive the response, extract the data. Once you learn this pattern with Claude today, you can apply it to any LLM service."

    "### The Request-Response Dance\n",
    "\n",
    "Every API interaction follows a simple rhythm: request, response. You ask, the LLM answers. But unlike human conversation where ambiguity is common, APIs demand precision. You need to specify exactly what you want, in exactly the right format, or the server will politely refuse to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down what actually happens when your Python code talks to an LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Request Contains:**\n",
    "- **The Prompt**: Your actual question or task, written as a string\n",
    "- **The Model**: Which LLM version to use (e.g., claude-sonnet-4-5, claude-haiku-4-5, claude-opus-4-1)\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Settings that control the response (like max_tokens for length, temperature for creativity)\n",
    "- **Your API Key**: A special password that identifies your account and tracks usage\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Response Delivers:**\n",
    "- **The Content**: The LLM's actual answer to your prompt\n",
    "- **Usage Information**: How many tokens were used (affects cost)\n",
    "- **Status Information**: Whether the request succeeded or failed\n",
    "- **Metadata**: Additional information like which model version actually processed your request\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure should feel familiar—it's just like functions you're used to working with. You provide inputs (arguments), the function processes them, and you get outputs (return values). The only difference is that the processing happens on a remote server instead of your laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this request-response pattern is crucial because it's universal across all web APIs, not just LLMs. Whether you're fetching astronomical data from NASA's databases, weather data, or generating text with Claude, the pattern is the same."

    "\n",
    "**Setting up Anthropic (Claude):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create an Account**\n",
    "   - Go to console.anthropic.com\n",
    "   - Click \"Sign up\" and create an account\n",
    "   - Verify your email address\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add Credits to Your Account**\n",
    "   - Once logged in, click on \"API Keys\" → \"Billing\" → \"Buy Credits\"\n",
    "   - Add at least $5 to get started (this will last for thousands of API calls)\n",
    "   - Enter your payment information\n",
    "   - Note: Without credits, your API calls will fail with an error about insufficient funds\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generate Your API Key**\n",
    "   - Navigate to \"API Keys\" → \"API Keys\" in your dashboard\n",
    "   - Click \"Create Key\"\n",
    "   - Give it a descriptive name like \"Astronomy Research Project\"\n",

    "     sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "### Understanding Tokens and Costs\n",
    " \n",
    "LLMs don't think in words—they think in \"tokens,\" which are more like syllables than complete words. Here are some examples:\n",
    "- \"astronomy\" → [\"astro\", \"nomy\"] (2 tokens)\n",
    "- \"star\" → [\"star\"] (1 token)  \n",
    "- \"Hello, world!\" → [\"Hello\", \",\", \" world\", \"!\"] (4 tokens)\n",
    " \n",
    "**Rule of thumb:** 1,000 tokens ≈ 750 words\n",
    " \n",
    "When you send a prompt to Claude, you pay for input tokens. When Claude responds, you pay for output tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Model Tier Strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every LLM company offers multiple models at different price points—think of it like choosing between a compact car and a luxury SUV. Both get you where you're going, but one is more economical while the other handles challenging terrain better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic offers three main Claude models (as of late 2025):\n",
    "- **Claude Opus 4.1**: $15/$75 per million input/output tokens - the most powerful model—excellent for complex reasoning, multi-step problems, and tasks requiring deep understanding\n",
    "- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: $3/$15 per million input/output tokens - balanced performance and cost, delivering excellent quality for most research tasks\n",
    "- **Claude Haiku 4.5**: $1/$5 per million input/output tokens - the fastest and most economical option, great for simple tasks and high-volume processing\n",
    "\n",
    "For most tasks, we'll use Claude Sonnet 4.5 because it offers an excellent balance of capability and cost. For simple, high-volume tasks like extracting data from observation logs, Haiku 4.5 can be very cost-effective. Let's break down the actual costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example calculation for analyzing one observation log:**\n",
    "- Your prompt: ~100 tokens (asking to extract data)\n",
    "- Claude's response: ~150 tokens (JSON with extracted fields)\n",
    "- Total: 250 tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "With **Haiku 4.5** pricing ($1/$5 per million tokens):\n",
    "- Input cost: 100 tokens × ($1/1,000,000) = $0.0001\n",
    "- Output cost: 150 tokens × ($5/1,000,000) = $0.00075\n",
    "- **Total per log: ~$0.00085**\n",
    "\n",
    "With **Sonnet 4.5** pricing ($3/$15 per million tokens):\n",
    "- Input cost: 100 tokens × ($3/1,000,000) = $0.0003\n",
    "- Output cost: 150 tokens × ($15/1,000,000) = $0.00225\n",
    "- **Total per log: ~$0.00255**\n",
    "\n",
    "With **Opus 4.1** pricing ($15/$75 per million tokens):\n",
    "- Input cost: 100 tokens × ($15/1,000,000) = $0.0015\n",
    "- Output cost: 150 tokens × ($75/1,000,000) = $0.01125\n",
    "- **Total per log: ~$0.01275**\n",
    "\n",
    "With your $5 credit:\n",
    "- **Haiku 4.5**: $5 ÷ $0.00085 = ~5,900 observation logs\n",
    "- **Sonnet 4.5**: $5 ÷ $0.00255 = ~1,960 observation logs\n",
    "- **Opus 4.1**: $5 ÷ $0.01275 = ~390 observation logs\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple extraction tasks like pulling galaxy names, dates, and observation parameters, Haiku 4.5 is incredibly cost-effective. Use Sonnet 4.5 for more complex analysis or when you need higher accuracy. Save Opus 4.1 for when you need the most sophisticated reasoning about the physical implications of your data.\n",

    "### Creating your .env file\n",

    "4. Save in your project folder (same folder as your notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "The format is simple: `VARIABLE_NAME=value` with no spaces around the equals sign, no quotes (unless they're part of the key itself). This format is called \"dotenv\" and it's an industry standard used by thousands of applications.\n",
