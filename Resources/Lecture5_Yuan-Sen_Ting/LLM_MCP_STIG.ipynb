    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Cast your mind back to Part 2 of this series. You built function tools that let Claude execute calculations—parallax to distance, stellar luminosity, orbital mechanics. You created schemas, handled tool requests, and sent results back through a careful dance of API calls. It worked beautifully for your astronomical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there were two significant drawbacks to that approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, every API call costs money. Each time you ran your notebook, you paid for tokens—for the prompt, for Claude's reasoning, for the response. When you're exploring and experimenting, asking \"what if I change this parameter?\" over and over, those costs add up. You might find yourself hesitating before running a cell, mentally calculating whether this exploration is worth another few cents. That hesitation is antithetical to good science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, your tools were trapped inside your notebook. The parallax calculator you built couldn't be used anywhere else without copying the code, the schema, the tool-handling logic—everything. Want to use those same calculations in a different project? Copy and paste. Want to share them with a colleague? Send them the whole notebook and hope they can figure it out. Your beautiful astronomical tools became prisoners of the notebook where you defined them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we solve both problems with the Model Context Protocol—MCP. MCP lets you package your astronomical tools into standalone servers that can be used by any compatible application. Most importantly for your day-to-day work, MCP lets you connect those tools to Claude Desktop, a chat application that uses your **subscription** rather than API credits. You can ask questions, run calculations, and explore freely without watching your wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cost Advantage: Subscription vs API\n",
    "\n",
    "This point deserves emphasis because it fundamentally changes how you can use LLMs in your research workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use the API directly (as covered in Parts 1 and 2), you pay per token. Every character in your prompt costs money. Every character in Claude's response costs money. If Claude reasons through a problem step by step, you pay for each step. This model makes sense for production systems where you're processing thousands of requests automatically, but it creates friction for interactive exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude Desktop works differently. With a Pro subscription (currently $20/month), you get generous usage limits for conversational interactions. When you connect your MCP tools to Claude Desktop, those tool calls happen within your subscription—no additional API charges. You can ask \"What's the equivalent width?\" then immediately follow up with \"What if the line were deeper?\" then \"How does that compare to thermal broadening?\" then \"Let me try a different temperature\"—all without cost anxiety.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't just about saving money (though that's nice). It's about removing barriers to exploration. Science advances through iteration, through \"what if\" questions, through following unexpected threads. When each question costs money, you unconsciously filter your curiosity. When questions are essentially free, you explore more freely.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Approach | Cost Model | Best For |\n",
    "|----------|-----------|----------|\n",
    "| API (Parts 1-2) | Pay per token | Automated pipelines, batch processing |\n",
    "| Claude Desktop + MCP | Subscription (flat rate) | Interactive exploration, learning, experimentation |\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP vs API: Conversational vs Programmatic\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder: why learn MCP when the API approach from Parts 1-2 already works?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that they serve fundamentally different purposes, and understanding when to use each will make you more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The API approach gives you programmatic control.** You write Python code that sends requests and processes responses. This is powerful for automated pipelines—processing hundreds of spectra, batch analyzing observation logs, or building production systems. But you pay per token, and you must manage conversations yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCP creates a conversational interface where Claude orchestrates your tools.** Users describe what they want in natural language, and Claude figures out which tools to call and how to combine them. This is excellent for exploration, for questions you didn't anticipate, for combining capabilities in unexpected ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a concrete example. Suppose you've built tools for spectroscopic analysis. With the API approach, you'd write code to call each function, process results, and handle the conversation loop. Every exploration costs tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "With MCP connected to Claude Desktop, you simply ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"What's the equivalent width for a line with depth 0.4 and FWHM 0.12 Angstroms?\"\n",
    "- \"Is that line on the linear part of the curve of growth?\"\n",
    "- \"What if the line were twice as deep?\"\n",
    "- \"Compare thermal broadening at 5000K vs 6000K for iron lines at 6000 Angstroms\"\n",
    "- \"Which of those scenarios would give me better abundance precision?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude orchestrates your tools to answer each question, combining them as needed, explaining the results in context. All within your subscription—no per-token costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The practical guidance:** Use the API (as covered in Parts 1-2) when you need programmatic control for automated pipelines. Use MCP + Claude Desktop when you want flexible, conversational exploration using your subscription. These aren't mutually exclusive—you might use MCP for exploration and prototyping, then switch to the API when you need to process data at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Build Today\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you'll have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A working MCP server with spectroscopic analysis tools (equivalent width, Doppler shifts, line broadening, curve of growth)\n",
    "2. Astronomical data resources that expose line lists and reference data to Claude\n",
    "3. Claude Desktop integration where you can use your tools through natural conversation\n",
    "4. Understanding of when to use MCP vs the API approach from Parts 1-2\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding How MCP Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing code, let's understand what MCP actually does. Don't worry if some concepts seem abstract initially—they'll become concrete once we start building.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Client-Server Model\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP uses a \"client-server\" architecture. If you've ever used a web browser, you've already experienced this pattern: your browser (the client) requests web pages from websites (the servers). The browser doesn't contain all the websites in the world—it just knows how to ask for them and display what comes back.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP works similarly. **MCP Clients** are applications that want to use tools. The main example we'll use is Claude Desktop—a standalone chat application from Anthropic that you install on your computer. When you chat with Claude Desktop and it needs to perform a calculation, it can ask an MCP server to do that calculation. Other clients exist too: IDE extensions, custom applications, even other chat interfaces. Any application that implements the MCP protocol can be a client.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCP Servers** are programs that provide tools and data. This is what you'll build: a Python program containing your astronomical functions. The server waits for requests, executes the appropriate function when asked, and sends back results. A server can provide multiple tools, and it can also provide data resources (like line lists or reference tables).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is **separation**. Your astronomical functions live in the server. The chat interface lives in the client. They communicate through a defined protocol (MCP), which means they can be developed, updated, and used independently. You could update your server with new tools without changing anything about Claude Desktop. You could use the same server with a different client application. This modularity is powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Separation Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 2, your tools were embedded directly in your notebook. The function, the schema, and the conversation-handling logic were all intertwined. This works fine for a single notebook, but consider what happens when you want to use the same calculations while chatting in Claude Desktop, share your tools with a colleague who uses different software, add your tools to a computing cluster, or update a calculation without breaking existing code that uses it.\n",
    "\n",
    "With embedded tools, each scenario requires copying and adapting code. With MCP, you write your tools once as a server, and any compatible client can use them. Update the server, and all clients automatically get the improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Communication Actually Works\n",
    "\n",
    "When Claude Desktop wants to use one of your tools, here's the sequence of events:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You ask a question.** \"What's the Doppler shift of H-alpha if a star is receding at 100 km/s?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Claude Desktop connects to your server.** When Claude Desktop starts, it launches your MCP server as a subprocess and establishes a communication channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Claude Desktop asks what tools are available.** The server responds with descriptions of all available tools—similar to the schemas you wrote in Part 2, but generated automatically from your Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Claude recognizes a calculation is needed.** Based on your question, Claude decides it should use a tool rather than just answering from memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Claude picks the right tool.** Looking at the available tools, Claude identifies `doppler_shift` as the appropriate one.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Claude Desktop sends the request.** It tells your server: \"Please run `doppler_shift` with `rest_wavelength_angstroms=6562.8` and `velocity_kms=100`.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Your server executes the function.** Your Python code runs, computing the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Your server returns the result.** The calculated values go back to Claude Desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Claude formulates a natural language response.** Claude takes the numerical result and writes an explanation for you: \"At 100 km/s recession velocity, H-alpha at 6562.8 Å would be observed at 6564.99 Å—a redshift of about 2.19 Å.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this happens automatically once you've set things up. You just chat naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools vs Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP servers can provide two kinds of capabilities. **Tools** are functions that perform calculations or actions—they take inputs and return outputs. Your `doppler_shift` function is a tool: give it a wavelength and velocity, get back an observed wavelength. **Resources** are data that clients can read, identified by URIs (like web addresses). A line list for iron absorption lines could be a resource—Claude can read it to know what lines are available, then use your tools to calculate properties of specific lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction matters for astronomical work. Your research often involves both calculations (tools) and reference data (resources). MCP lets you expose both through the same server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Note on Terminology: Transports\n",
    "\n",
    "You might encounter the word \"transport\" in MCP documentation. This refers to how the client and server send messages to each other. The most common transport is \"stdio\" (standard input/output)—Claude Desktop launches your server as a subprocess and communicates through text pipes. You don't need to understand the details; the MCP library handles everything. Just know that when documentation mentions \"stdio transport,\" it means \"the normal way Claude Desktop talks to local servers.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's install the MCP library. This handles all the communication protocol details so you can focus on writing astronomical functions."

    "### Understanding the Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCP library provides several building blocks. For most astronomical applications, you'll use three:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`FastMCP`**: A class that creates an MCP server. Think of it as the container that holds your tools and handles all communication. You create one FastMCP instance, register your functions with it, and it manages everything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`@mcp.tool()` decorator**: A decorator that marks a Python function as an MCP tool. Decorators are the `@something` syntax you put above function definitions—they modify how the function behaves. In this case, `@mcp.tool()` tells MCP \"this function should be available as a tool that Claude can call.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**`@mcp.resource()` decorator**: Similar, but for data resources. You mark a function that returns data, and MCP makes that data available for clients to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key insight: No manual schemas required.** Remember in Part 2, you had to write JSON schemas like this for every function?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Part 2 approach - manual schema for EACH function\n",
    "parallax_tool = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"calculate_distance\",\n",
    "    \"description\": \"Calculate distance from parallax\",\n",
    "    \"input_schema\": {\n",
    "        \"type\": \"object\",\n",
    "        \"properties\": {\n",
    "            \"parallax_arcsec\": {\n",
    "                \"type\": \"number\",\n",
    "                \"description\": \"Parallax angle in arcseconds\"\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        \"required\": [\"parallax_arcsec\"]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With MCP, you write none of that. The `@mcp.tool()` decorator automatically reads your function's **name**, **type hints**, and **docstring** to generate the schema. Your docstring becomes the tool description. Your parameter type hints become the input schema. This means writing good docstrings isn't just good practice—it's how you tell Claude what your tool does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see this in action.\n",

    "## Your First MCP Server\n",

    "\n",
    "The **imports and server creation** at the top (`from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP` and `mcp = FastMCP(\"Spectral Line Analyzer\")`) create an MCP server object. The name you provide (\"Spectral Line Analyzer\") appears in Claude Desktop to help you identify which server provides which tools.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Type hints are essential**. The `: float` annotations (like `line_depth: float`) tell MCP what kind of data each parameter expects. Without these, MCP can't properly describe the tool to Claude. Always include type hints for MCP tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The docstring is crucial**. Your docstring is what Claude reads to understand when and how to use the tool. Write it as you would for a knowledgeable colleague—clear, with physical context, including units. Claude uses this description to decide whether your tool is appropriate for a given question.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's appreciate how dramatically simpler this is compared to Part 2's approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Part 2**, creating a usable tool required seven separate pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Writing the function itself\n",
    "2. Writing a separate JSON schema describing the function's parameters\n",
    "3. Adding code to detect when Claude wanted to use a tool (checking `stop_reason`)\n",
    "4. Adding code to extract the tool request and parse the arguments\n",
    "5. Adding code to execute the function with those arguments\n",
    "6. Adding code to send results back to Claude in the right format\n",
    "7. Managing the conversation loop manually\n",
    "\n",
    "**With MCP**, you need just one thing: write your function with the `@mcp.tool()` decorator and a good docstring. That's it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a concrete comparison. To create an equivalent width tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2 (manual schema + handling code):**\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is Claude Desktop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this series, you've interacted with Claude in two ways: the **web interface** at claude.ai—you type in a chat box and get responses, simple and convenient, but you can't connect it to your own tools; and the **API** (Parts 1-2)—you write Python code that sends requests and processes responses programmatically, powerful and automatable, but you pay per token and must manage conversations yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claude Desktop** is a third option. It's a standalone application you install on your computer. It looks and feels like the web interface—a chat window where you type questions and get responses—but with crucial differences: it can connect to MCP servers running on your machine, it uses your subscription rather than API credits, and Claude can automatically use your tools when answering questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination makes Claude Desktop ideal for research exploration: unlimited conversational interactions with your own astronomical tools, at no incremental cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing and Launching Claude Desktop\n",
    "\n",
    "Download Claude Desktop from: **https://claude.ai/download**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. Install it like any other application. When you first open it, sign in with your Anthropic account (the same one you use at claude.ai).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write some helper functions to detect your operating system and manage Claude Desktop. The following code uses several Python standard library modules that are useful for cross-platform programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`platform.system()`**: Returns the operating system name—\"Darwin\" for macOS, \"Windows\" for Windows, \"Linux\" for Linux. This lets us write code that behaves differently on each OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`os.path.expanduser(\"~\")`**: Expands the `~` symbol to your home directory path. On macOS this might be `/Users/yourname`, on Linux `/home/yourname`, on Windows `C:\\Users\\yourname`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`os.environ.get(\"VARNAME\", default)`**: Reads environment variables. Windows uses variables like `APPDATA` and `LOCALAPPDATA` to store standard paths. The second argument provides a fallback if the variable isn't set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`os.path.join()`**: Joins path components using the correct separator for your OS (`/` on Mac/Linux, `\\` on Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`sys.executable`**: The path to the Python interpreter currently running your code. This is important because Claude Desktop needs to know exactly which Python to use."

    "Now that you have one working server, you might want to add more tools. Here's an important insight: **Claude Desktop can connect to multiple servers simultaneously**. Rather than putting all your tools in one giant file, you can create focused servers for different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ew_server.py` — equivalent width calculations\n",
    "- `doppler_server.py` — Doppler shift and velocity calculations\n",
    "- `broadening_server.py` — line broadening calculations\n",
    "- `data_server.py` — reference data and line lists\n",
    "\n",
    "This modular approach has several advantages:\n",
    "1. **Each file stays small and readable** — easier to understand and debug\n",
    "2. **You can update one server without touching others** — less risk of breaking things\n",
    "3. **You can share individual servers** — give a colleague just the Doppler tools\n",
    "4. **Servers can be developed independently** — work on broadening while Doppler is stable\n",

    "### Keep Tools Focused\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tool should do one thing well. Instead of one massive `analyze_spectrum` function with many parameters and modes, provide focused tools that can be combined. Claude can chain `estimate_ew_from_depth`, then `curve_of_growth_regime`, then `thermal_broadening` as needed. This modularity makes tools easier to test, easier to document, and more flexible in how they can be combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modular server approach we used in this lecture—separate files for Doppler, broadening, analysis, and data—exemplifies this principle at the server level too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Before Deploying\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify your functions produce correct results for known cases. H-alpha at 100 km/s recession should show a shift of about 2.19 Å. Iron at 5000K should have thermal broadening of about 2.9 km/s. Write tests using known astronomical values to catch errors before they reach users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, you've learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: A standard for packaging tools that LLMs can discover and use, enabling your code to work with multiple interfaces while writing it only once\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No More Manual Schemas**: Unlike Part 2 where you wrote JSON schemas for each function, MCP automatically generates schemas from your type hints and docstrings—just write good documentation!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Models**: The crucial difference between API-based access (pay per token) and Claude Desktop (subscription)—MCP with Claude Desktop enables interactive exploration at no incremental cost\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular Server Architecture**: How to build focused, single-purpose servers that Claude Desktop can use simultaneously—avoiding code repetition and making maintenance easier\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tools vs Resources**: The distinction between calculations (tools) and data (resources), and how combining both creates more capable assistants\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatic Configuration**: Using Python to detect your system, configure Claude Desktop, and launch the application—avoiding manual JSON editing and forgotten steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Can Now Do\n",
    "\n",
    "After working through this material, you can package **any astronomical calculation** as an MCP tool accessible through natural conversation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database Queries & Coordinates**: Build a server that queries Simbad, converts coordinates between systems, or calculates angular separations—ask Claude \"What's the galactic coordinates of Vega?\" and get instant answers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observation Planning**: Create tools that calculate airmass, find observable targets, or check Moon separation—\"Is M31 observable tonight from Mauna Kea?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ephemerides**: Wrap Skyfield calculations for planet positions, rise/set times, or conjunction finding—\"When does Jupiter rise tomorrow?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Curve Fitting**: Package your optimization routines—\"Fit a linear trend to this proper motion data\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transit Analysis**: Expose transit fitting functions—\"What planet radius does this 1.2% transit depth imply for a Sun-like star?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Photometry**: Create PSF fitting and aperture photometry tools—\"Estimate the magnitude from these source counts\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spectroscopy**: Build the equivalent width and line profile tools we created today—\"What's the thermal broadening for iron at 5500K?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern is always the same: write a function with good docstrings and type hints, add `@mcp.tool()`, and it becomes accessible through Claude Desktop. You now have the skills to turn any astronomical calculation into a conversational tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Series Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations—you've completed this three-part tutorial series on building LLM-powered research agents!\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Part 1**, you learned API fundamentals: authentication, requests, parameters, building conversations, managing context, prompting strategies, structured outputs, and vision models for image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Part 2**, you mastered function tools and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): creating function schemas, building astronomical calculation tools, implementing document chunking and embedding-based search, and combining function tools with RAG for powerful research assistants.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Part 3 (this tutorial)**, you've learned to package your tools as standalone MCP servers that work with Claude Desktop, enabling subscription-based interactive exploration without per-token costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCP servers you built today can wrap any astronomical technique: query Simbad, convert coordinates, fit a transit model, measure equivalent widths—all accessible through natural conversation. Your code is no longer trapped in notebooks. It's infrastructure that can power your research in whatever interface suits the moment.\n",
